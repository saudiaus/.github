These results, combined with the poor form of Saudi Arabia, means the Socceroos are back in contention to qualify automatically for the World Cup, but know this match against the Saudis is pivotal to those dreams becoming a reality.

The poor form from the Gulf nation saw Roberto Mancini sacked, with his replacement being the man who led them to victory over Argentina at the 2022 World Cup, Herve Renard.
